# Composable Batch Files

. . . is a productivity and scripting tool in the form of a collection of batch files that are 
scalable, convention-based and self-documenting batch files that can execute a single function 
or be snapped together like legos to create a whole Millennium Falcon script.

## Most Batch Files Are a Mess

Many batch files I've seen in the wild are pretty messy. They are often quite long and not 
well structured. I know this partly because I've written hundreds like them. I wrote batch 
files for years that were a mess. I like to think I'm a little better now.

that bad compared many I've seen.
