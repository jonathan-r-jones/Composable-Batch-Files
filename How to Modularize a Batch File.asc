;Introduction

:So you wanna give a tech talk? tech talk tips and tricks: 
https://www.happybearsoftware.com/tips-on-giving-your-first-technical-talk

:Tell a story. Perhaps you can show your editor side-by-side with the command line. I built 
mirror.bat for this purpose.

:See Cory House's speaker resource: &chsr

:As an example perhaps you could write clc.bat from scratch.

::As an example perhaps you could write gg.bat from scratch.

:If you have questions, please ask.

:Why are most long batch files overly complex? For the same reason, I would argue, that most 
long functions. The problem is the LONG part. The solution is modularization.

:If only there were a way to separate out things into functions, like most programming 
languages.

:Set default browser to IE.



;Chapter 1 - How to Modularize

:The problem is that there is no concept of a function. So let's change that. At the heart 
of Combosable Batch File Framework is the notion of a function, do something and get out. 
Master the command line.

::goto %1 in large letters. Does anyone know what this does in a batch file.

::Just like a function, a batch file label must be unique within a file.

:4 of the coolest things to know about a batch file:

batch file labels

exit/b

goto %1

call %0

:Wouldn't it be cool if we could juxtapose the command and code windows?

:label = goto %1 = function name

:exit /b = }

:empty function, somewhat arbitrary

::full function

::anatomy of a function



;Chapter 2 - Let's See Some Action

:calc v. clc.bat (demonstrates the same basic concepts)

:g.bat

::log

::status

::multiple aliases

::rollback

::Own it. This is how I think about it. Very powerful for remembering things.



;Chapter 3 - Some Cool Examples

:Perhaps start with a blank n.bat file.

:Do the sln search in xu like I did for Andrew.

::Could be used for song title searches, which I have doing for years.

c:\cbf

:td: Navigating

::possilbly framework's most used function

:of

:(!qjq)

:s

:sf: Web surfing

:cn

:fs

:cs



;Chapter 4 - How to Customize CBF, If You Care

:Perhaps showing an example of how one might use the end product might be good way to 
illustrate. Show Xamarin Essentials.

:I call your attention to goto %1 in g, m and n.

The concpet of nicknames.

How do I know where to surf to?

m.bat: methods/YOUR METHODS

n.bat: nicknames/properties/YOUR DATA

Remember to goto %1



;Conclusion

:If I told you n.bat was a million lines long, would you care?

:Do you feel like you know what's going on with bat file? Is it predictable? Are you 
confident you know what the flow is? Simple right?

:Helps to organize, helps to remembering commands that you use.
