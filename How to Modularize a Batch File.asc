;Introduction - Thesis

:H have never presented on this so things will probably be a bit rough.

:Everything in this talk can be downloaded from my GitHub repo. at ...

:Does anybody use batch files?

::Seems like a good idea that I want to share.

:In most programming languages there's a concept of a function. This concept seems to be 
missing from batch file programming.

:I wrote batch files for years that were a mess. Not until I imposed a structure, did I become 
really productive.

:Tell a story. Perhaps you can show your editor side-by-side with the command line. I built 
mirror.bat for this purpose.

:See Cory House's speaker resource: &chsr

:If only there were a way to separate out things into functions, like most programming 
languages.

:Why are most long batch files overly complex? For the same reason, I would argue, that most 
long functions are. The problem is the LONG part. The solution is modularization.



;How to Modularize

:The problem is that there is no concept of a function. So let's change that. At the heart 
of Combosable Batch File Framework is the notion of a function, do something and get out. 
Master the command line.

::goto %1 in large letters. Does anyone know what this does in a batch file.

::Just like a function, a batch file label must be unique within a file.

:Does anyone know what any of these do?

exit/b

goto %1

call %0

:4 of the coolest things to know about a batch file:

batch file labels equala function name

:Wouldn't it be cool if we could juxtapose the command and code windows?

:label = goto %1 = function name = nickname

:exit/b = }

:empty function, somewhat arbitrary

::full function

::anatomy of a function



;Let's see Hello World

:Setup Instructions

:Do hello world.bat example

::correlation of percent 1 and first thing you type

::Is this goto confusing? I would argue no.



;How to Extend and Customize CBF, If You Care, Examples That Are Built on this Structure

:For help: Use "/?". For example, at the c:\ prompt, type "m/?".

:For a list of CBF batch files, type "cbf" at the prompt.

:m.bat: methods/YOUR METHODS

::m/?: You don't need to care about all these functions because why? You're going to name your 
function, which is all you need to worry about.

:td and of

::td: Navigating

::possilbly framework's most used function

::fast navigation. You are assigning a shortcut to a unique nickname.

:sf: Web surfing

::c:\sf ttdc

::c:\sf cnn

::bookmarks

:n.bat: nicknames/properties/YOUR DATA

:I call your attention to goto %1 in m and n.

:The concpet of nicknames.

:How do I know where to surf to?



;Some Cool Batch Files, 2 Examples

:To see a table of contents list of off-the-shelf cbfs, type "cbf".

::All these batch files are built in a composable and structured way.

:I am constantly adding new batch files. I can't help myself.

:I don't like the windows file searcher in Windows Explorer.

:fs

::td xu, fs *.sln over 400 solutions!

::Could be used for song title searches, which I have doing for years.

:cs: ImageSource.FromUri



;Conclusion

:Once you know the structure and the design philosophy, it's not complicated.

:Do you feel like you know what's going on with bat file? Is it predictable? Are you 
confident you know what the flow is? Simple right?

:Helps to organize, helps to remembering commands that you use.
